# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations
This repository contains a number of example implementations of popular machine learning algorithms. This is just to practice my familiarity with the algorithms. The majority of these implementations should be accompanied by a blog post.

## Variational Autoencoder Implementation

Basic implementation of a variational autoencoder in a Jupyter Notebook.

Find the blog post that goes along with this code on my website https://www.andrewszot.com/blog/machine_learning/variational_autoencoders.
